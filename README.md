# Todot
Todot is a kanban styled (trello like) todo and planning addon for the godot game engien

Why
--
Going to trello back and forth is kinda daunting. With this you have it as a new tab among the 2d 3d asset-lib. This is offline and you have it godot what more could you ask for? ( Note: This is an actual question i want you to make issues for the features you need or that is never gonna come to todot. )

How to install?
--
Download this repository then copy the addon folder to your project root. If you have any other addons installed you might have to copy the Todot folder inside the addons folder to the addons directory inside your project

How to pronounce?
--
Depends. If you pronounce Godot as go - doh then pronounce it as to - doh. If you pronounce Godot as go - dot. then call it to-dot.

How is the data saved?
--
I collect all data and save it using the stor_var function in gdscript
